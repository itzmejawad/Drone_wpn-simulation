# auto-mission-prepare-for-mission-planner

This script is to automatically create missions for pixhawk,APM or any DroneCode based controller that uses Mission Planner. You can create waypoints, region of interests etc based on your algorithm and then it can be opened from Mission Planner/ Flight Plan/ Load WP File. You can review or modify it on mission planner before sending it to the drone. More detailed description can be found here:  http://talhakorkmaz.com/drone/preparing_auto_mission/
